## **Learning Objective: By the end of this module, learners should be able to write and evaluate logical expressions in Go.**

## Part 1: Operators in Go (10 minutes)

    - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
        - ++, ==, !=, <=, >=, ||, &&

## Part 2: Control Structures (10 minutes)

    - If-else statements

In Go, you can define an `if` statement without the else. That means, that if you have some two options and one is the default behavior you can put the optional behavior behind a single if statement.

<!-- This would be an idea place for code. -->

If there are more that two options for behavior instead of using the keyword `else if`, engineers will typically use the `switch` keyword with and provided conditional `cases`. - Switch statements

## Part 3: Looping Constructs (10 minutes)

    - For loops
        - C style
        - While style
    - Range loops
        - rang over num
        - range over function
