## Part 1: Introduction to CLI Applications (10 minutes)

If you have been writing sofware int he past few years, then you have probably used a CLI application written in Go. Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and many other popular tools are written in Go. 

In this module we will write a simple CLI application. I encourage you to follow along and write the code as we go. This will help you understand the concepts better.

    - Basics of CLI applications
    - Setting up a CLI project
## Part 2: Building the CLI Application (10 minutes)
    - Handling user input

        - Command-line flags vs. arguments
    - Executing commands
        - Using the `os/exec` package
        - Running external commands
## Part 3: Packaging and Distributing the CLI Application (10 minutes)
    - Compiling and distributing binaries
    - Cross-compilation
