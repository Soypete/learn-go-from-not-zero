## Part 1: Introduction to Testing in Go (10 minutes)

Testing is an essential part of software development. Go has a  testing package built into the Standard Library. This is the defacto testing framework for unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarking. In Go, tests are written in the same package as the code they are testing, and test files are named `*_test.go`.

    - Writing simple test functions
## Part 2: Table-Driven Tests (10 minutes)
    - Structuring table-driven tests
    - Advantages of table-driven tests
## Part 3: Test Coverage and Other Testing Tools (10 minutes)
    - Measuring test coverage
    - Additional testing tools and practices (e.g., benchmarks, mock testing)
